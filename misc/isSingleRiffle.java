/*
I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single " riffle â†´ ."

To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffledDeck is
a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.

We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1..521..52
(since there are 5252 distinct cards in a deck).
